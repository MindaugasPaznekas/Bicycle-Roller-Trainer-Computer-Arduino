# Bicycle-Roller-Trainer-Computer-Arduino
I made my roller trainer for bicycle a little bit smarter by mounting Arduino with an lcd screen and Hall sensor which helps it track the distance and speed I am going

Use Arduino IDE to compile
You will need library https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/liquid-crystal-i2-c
For the project I used chinese arduino nano v3 clone and LCD 1602 HD44780 I2C display from ebay for Â£4.74
Tiny 2mm neodymium magnet from ebay
KY-003 Hall Effect Magnetic Sensor Module 2GBP for 5 pcs https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/292200735999
I have Elite Arion roller trainer https://www.elite-it.com/en/products/home-trainers/rollers/arion
Arduino was attached with double sided tape

Connection diagram TBD
